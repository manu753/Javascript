//some people prefer to create object instances without first creating constructors, especially if they are creating only a few instances of an object. JavaScript has a built-in method called create() that allows you to do that. With it, you can create a new object based on any existing object.

var person_two=Object.create(person_one);

//You'll see that person2 has been created based on person1â€”it has the same properties and method available to it.
//One limitation of create() is that IE8 does not support it. So constructors may be more effective if you want to support older browsers.
console.log(person_two);
//accessing the property
console.log(person_two.name.first);
console.log(person_two.greet());
